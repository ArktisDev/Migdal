# Do NOT use /gps/energy to set the energy. Documentation says /gps/energy === /gps/ene/mono but they are not.
# /gps/energy forces mono distribution, /gps/ene/mono does not (for what reason????)
# Also if you run /gps/source/list you can ignore the "Energy" row, it is just plain incorrect.
# The energy row shows the previous shot particle's energy, which is 1 MeV if you have not shot anything. - Lars
